Container to Container communications


Why Do Containers Need to Communicate with Each Other?
In microservices architecture, container communication is essential because:


  ‚úÖ 1. Separation of concerns
Each container handles a single responsibility:
Container	Role
web container	Runs the frontend (e.g., React/Angular/Nginx)
api container	Runs the backend (e.g., Node.js/Flask)
db container	Runs a database (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
‚è© They must talk to each other for the full app to work.


‚úÖ 2. Common Real-World Use Cases
Example	Explanation
web ‚Üí app	Frontend (HTML/JS) sends request to backend service
app ‚Üí db	Backend queries the database for data
nginx ‚Üí app	Nginx reverse-proxies traffic to application container
worker ‚Üí redis	Background job processing (e.g., Celery with Redis)


‚úÖ 3. DevOps / CI-CD Scenarios
When testing or deploying apps via CI/CD pipelines, we often spin up:
‚Ä¢	App container
‚Ä¢	DB container
‚Ä¢	Test container
They must communicate to simulate production behavior.


üß± Bottom Line:
Communication between containers is crucial when:
‚Ä¢	Building multi-tier applications
‚Ä¢	Creating test environments
‚Ä¢	Using service-based architectures
‚Ä¢	Configuring reverse proxies, queues, or shared file systems


steps to do this container to container communications as below --

1 create the comman network by the command 
docker network create -d bridge testnetwork


2 create 2 conntianers in that networks by the command 

docker run -it --name container1 --network=testnetwork ubuntu /bin/bash
docker run -it --name conatiner2 --network=testnetwork ubuntu /bin/bash

3 Install ping or curl (optional)
-	docker exec -it container1 bash
-	apt update && apt install -y iputils-ping curl net-tools

Test communication
-	ping container2

you will get the response back from the ping command, that means our both the containers are communicating to each others...
do this vice varsa if you needed..
