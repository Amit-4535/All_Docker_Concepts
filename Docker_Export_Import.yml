Docker Export and Import

Export 
Basically we are converting our containers into the tarfile..
docker export takes a snapshot of the container’s filesystem, i.e. all files and directories inside the container, and saves them to a .tar file.

Command	Works On	Purpose
docker export	A container	Exports the container’s filesystem as a .tar archive
docker import	A tar archive	Creates a new image from the exported .tar file


command to create the tar file from the container

docker export fb5d2bc2514a > tarfilename.tar
docker export fb5d2bc2514a -o tarfilename1.tar

(this command basically will convert the mentioned container id into the tarfile)


command to import the tarfile into the image.

docker image import tarfilename.tar newimage

(this command will importing the tarfile into the image)
